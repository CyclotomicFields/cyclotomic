        Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA)

        BÃ©zout's identity states that the GCD of any two numbers can be
        represented as a linear combination of those numbers. We exploit use
        this property in the algorithm to represent our progress in Euclid's
        algorithm towards determining the GCD.
        That is, m*k1 + n*k2 = gcd(m, n) for some integers k1 and k2.

        The algorithm proceeds by constructing a matrix and augmenting it by
        logically appending a row to the bottom, in each iteration. The initial
        matrix represents the a trivial pair of linear combinations for m and n
        and it looks like this, where m >= n.

        m 1 0
        n 0 1

        Every row represents a linear combination of m and n. Each iteration of
        the algorithm will result in appending a new row to the bottom of this
        matrix. To construct the next row, we would take the quotient and of a
        division m / n. The row is then the second-to-bottom row of the matrix
        minus the quotient multiplied by the bottom row of the matrix. In this
        case, that would be (m 1 0) - k * (n 0 1) where k is the integer part
        of m / n.

        We repeat this process, continually adding rows to the bottom of the
        matrix, until we get a remainder of 0, that is, the value in the
        left-most column of the bottom row is 0. At this point, we can say that
        the GCD of n and m is the remainder in the second-to-bottom row,
        according to Euclid's original algorithm.
