To run the benchmarks, make sure you have compiled anticbench and
installed GAP. (TODO: document how to do that)

Then run:

    $ ./run_bench.sh 100000

To generate the benchmark data by runnning 100,000 dot products using
each of: the antic library, the cyclotomic library, and the GAP
system.

To plot the graphs, you can use:

   $ cd results
   $ ../plot.py -x 0 "\$n\$" -y 1 "time taken (ms)" -f "Antic 0.2.1" antic -f "cyclotomic 0.1.0" cyclotomic -f "GAPÂ 4.11.0" gap

which specifies the x and y axes, the filenames with the data, and the
legend labels to use for the data coming from each file.
